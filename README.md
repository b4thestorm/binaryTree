# binaryTree
Working on creating and traversing tree's

Tree's can be traversed with 
   Breadth first search - (using a Queue FIFO) - Level Order Traversal
   
     Use a Queue
     
        • Start at root node
        
        • while Queue is not empty
        
        • add all children into Queue
        
        • execute code on the current node (root node)
        
        • shift the first item off the queue 
        
        • repeat from bullet 2
       
   Depth first search  - (using a Stack LIFO) 
   
        in pre - order  ---> action - left - right
        
        in In-order ---> left - action - right 
        
        in Post Order ---> left - right - action 
        
   This refers to the order of when nodes undergo Action
   
       • start at root node 
       
       • perform an action - BASED ON order
       
       • setup base cases - when do you need to stop traversal
       
       • setup recursive case
       
   heaps -> 
   
     priority queue systems
     
     implementing heap sort
     
     optimized path finding 
     
     • Djikstra's method (Graphs and Heaps)
